# Linear-Regression
# Linear Regression from Scratch ðŸš€

This is my first machine learning project! I implemented linear regression **without using machine learning libraries like scikit-learn**. This project helped me understand the math behind:

- Cost function
- Gradient descent
- Data visualization


## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- How to compute gradients manually
- How to train a linear regression model using numpy
- How to visualize training data and loss
